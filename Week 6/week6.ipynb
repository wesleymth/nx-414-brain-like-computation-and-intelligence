    "# Week 6 - Mini project (Predicting neural activity)\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of the mini project are:\n",
    "- Learn how to predict neural activity using linear regression from images and from neural network layers.\n",
    "- Quantify the goodness of the model\n",
    "- Compare the results across the network layers and between trained/random neural network\n",
    "- Predict the neural activity using a neural network in a data-driven approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, here you will use the data from the following [paper](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/35/39/13402.full.pdf). The behavioral experiment consisted in showing to non-human primates some images while recording the neural activity with multielectrode arrays from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex. In the data we provided you, the neural activity and the images are already pre-processed and you will have available the images and the corresponding average firing rate (between 70 and 170 ms) per each neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deadline for Mini-Project Submission: May 7, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to submit your mini-projects by midnight on 07/05/25. Please upload a .zip file to Moodle containing your code, along with the following specific components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One-Page Report (Report.pdf): This should detail your investigative process and include:\n",
    "    - A comparison table of models. This should cover linear regression from stimuli, both trained and random task-driven models, data-driven models, and your best-performing model.\n",
    "    - A figure illustrating the variation in neural prediction across different layers of a task-driven model.\n",
    "    - Your exploration to develop the most effective model at predicting IT neural activity\n",
    "- Example Script/Notebook: Please provide a script (test.py) or a notebook (test.ipynb) demonstrating how your best model performs on the validation set. This should serve as an example of the model's usage."

Let's test this hypothesis by loading a pre-trained ResNet50 model and use the activations of each layer to predict the neural activity. Follow these steps:\n",
